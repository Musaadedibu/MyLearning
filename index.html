        <p>"Believe you can and you are halfway there" {Theodore Roosevelt}. In curiosity of fulfilling my unwavering knack for technology, I started to delve into the world of web development and it's such a fulfilling journey for me start. The first most important Question I will like you to answer is to find your WHY! WHY do/are you learning to code. It might seems like just a simple question, but I was never finding that gritty conviction not until I was able to get the right in-depth answer to this "simple" question.</p>
